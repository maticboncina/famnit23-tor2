# UP FAMNIT - TOR II (Teorija formalnih jezikov in izračunjivost) - 2023/2024

Profesor: dr. Branko Kavšek

## Intro 

The repository serves as a personal archive of TOR II course at UP FAMNIT. 

**!!! Code in this repository is a wild mix of genius and "oopsie doopsies" - it’s shared !!! after !!! submitting my assignments, so expect adventures (and bugs). Use or copy at your risk !!!**

**FOR "I AM THE SMARTEST IDIOT" CLASSMATE(S): this IS NOT a free ride for your homework. When you get caught using my gigabrain, I'll proudly wave this repository, timestamps, hidden indicators, as proof of my originality while you get a front-row seat to your ethics hearing. Consider yourself warned 💅**

## Folder structure

1. Classification based on class type:
    - `homework` - Homework assignments

2. Organised uploads by dates (yyyy-mm-dd) or by assignment number:
    - Numbered by the order of the assignment (Nx) (x = 1, 2, 3, ...) - **Homeworks only**

3. Optionally organised further to maintain a clean structure.
